# Node.js Logistics Management Workshop: Real Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Node.js Logistics Management workshop. This project is designed to apply basic concepts of Node.js, Express, promises, and the difference between development and production dependencies. You will create a RESTful API that interacts with the file system instead of a database.

## Submission Instructions

1. Create a repository on GitHub named `nodejs-logistics-project`.
2. Follow the instructions and complete the objectives outlined in this document.
3. Upload your project to GitHub and share the repository link.

## Objectives

1. Set up a Node.js development environment.
2. Create a web server using Node.js and Express.
3. Implement routes and middleware in Express.
4. Read and write data in the file system using the `fs` module with promises.
5. Handle errors and secure the RESTful API with middleware.
6. Understanding status codes and response bodies.
7. Differentiate between development and production dependencies.
8. Design relational model for the required entities.

## Project Description

You will create a RESTful API to manage logistics information. The entities to be managed are: **Warehouses**, **Shipments**, **Drivers**, and **Vehicles**. Each entity will be stored in a JSON file in the file system.

### Warehouse

A warehouse is a building for storing goods. It has the following properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the warehouse.
- **Name**: The name of the warehouse.
- **Location**: The location of the warehouse.

### Shipment

A shipment is a load of goods that is transported from one place to another. It has the following properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the shipment.
- **Item**: The name of the item being shipped.
- **Quantity**: The quantity of the item being shipped.

### Driver

A driver is a person who drives a vehicle to transport goods. It has the following properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the driver.
- **Name**: The name of the driver.

### Vehicle

A vehicle is a machine used to transport goods. It has the following properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the vehicle.
- **Model**: The model of the vehicle.
- **Year**: The year the vehicle was manufactured.

## Relationship Between Entities

- A warehouse can have multiple shipments. However, a shipment can only belong to one warehouse.
- A driver can drive multiple vehicles. However, a vehicle can only be driven by one driver.
- A vehicle can transport multiple shipments. However, a shipment can only be transported by one vehicle.
- A shipment can be transported by one driver. However, a driver can transport multiple shipment.
- A driver can work in one warehouse. However, a warehouse can have multiple drivers.
- A vehicle can be parked in multiple warehouses. However, a warehouse can only have one vehicle parked.
- A warehouse can have multiple drivers. However, a driver can only work in one warehouse.
